## Introduction
This is a simple clone of Google homepage created as a part of The Odin Project.
CSS code can be better organized with comments for each section, inherited properties can be reorganized a bit and reduce duplication of code. HTML code can be grouped in many different ways. I could minimize code or use a variety of tags that better represent the elements/items.
Please note that this version has not been optimised for mobile use.

Buttons bottom search bar are clickable. When you click "Google Search" you will be redirected to the results.

There are no pictures in the navigation menu, but they are not the most important thing in this project.
