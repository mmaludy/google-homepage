# Google Homepage clone
A simple clone of Google homepage created as a part of The Odin Project.

CSS code can be better organized with comments for each section, inherited properties can be reorganized a bit and reduce duplication of code. HTML code can be grouped in many different ways. I could minimize code or use a variety of tags that better represent the elements/items.

Search function doesn not work but that is not the purpose of this project.
